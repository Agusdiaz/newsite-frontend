            The aim of this project is to improve my front-end abilities. By
            using React, HTML and SCSS, I have developed every component from
            scratch, without the help of any UI library. You can try the
            light/dark theme. Also, this APP is 100% responsive ðŸ’»ðŸ“±. <br />
            Currently, there is no back-end service created for this
            application, that is why I am using{" "}

              }}

            . Eventually, in the future, I will connect both applications (front
            and back end).
